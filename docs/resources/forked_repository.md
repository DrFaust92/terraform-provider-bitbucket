  Provides a Bitbucket Repository

# bitbucket\_forked\_repository

Provides a Bitbucket repository resource that is forked from a parent repo.

This resource allows you manage properties of the fork, if it is
private, how to fork the repository and other options. SCM cannot be overridden,
as it is inherited from the parent repository. Creation will fail if the parent
repo has `no_forks` as its fork policy.

OAuth2 Scopes: `repository`, `repository:admin`, and `repository:delete`

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "bitbucket_forked_repository" "infrastructure" {
  owner = "myteam"
  name  = "terraform-code"
}
```

If you want to create a repository with a CamelCase name, you should provide
a separate slug

```hcl
resource "bitbucket_forked_repository" "infrastructure" {
  owner = "myteam"
  name  = "TerraformCode"
  slug  = "terraform-code"
  
  parent = {
    owner = bitbucket_repository.test.owner
    slug  = bitbucket_repository.test.slug
  }
}
```
