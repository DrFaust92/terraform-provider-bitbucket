## Example Usage

resource "bitbucket_workspace_hook" "deploy_on_push" {
  workspace   = "myteam"
  url         = "https://mywebhookservice.mycompany.com/deploy-on-push"
  description = "Deploy the code via my webhook"

  events = [
    "repo:push",
  ]
}
```

  have write access to.
* `url` - (Required) Where to POST to.
* `description` - (Required) The name / description to show in the UI.
* `events` - (Required) The events this webhook is subscribed to. Valid values can be found at [Bitbucket Webhook Docs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-repositories/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-hooks-post).
